Welcome to the Arcade Games Collection! This repository contains two exciting console-based games â€“ Lucky Number and Hangman. Have fun testing your luck and word-guessing skills!

## Lucky Number Game

In this game, you'll be challenged to guess the Lucky Number between 0 and 9. Simply input your guess, and if you get it right, you win! Otherwise, the correct answer will be revealed. Try your luck and see if you can hit the jackpot!

## Hangman

Get ready for a classic game of Hangman! A random word will be selected, and you have to guess the letters to reveal the hidden word. Be careful, though â€“ you only have 6 lives! The initial visible letters are strategically chosen to add an extra twist. Can you guess the word before running out of lives?
